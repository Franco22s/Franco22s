## Hello there! I'm Franco Silva 👋


## About Me
I am a web developer in constant training, passionate about creating innovative digital solutions. My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, and I currently possess a strong foundation in web programming. My language of choice is JavaScript, through which I have built interactive and dynamic applications that enhance user experience.

Before I got into web development, I was studying psychology at college. But as I kept going, I realized I actually really love technology.

This big change in my path not only let me follow my passion, but also gave me a special way of looking at things by mixing psychology with technology. Because of my psychology background, I'm really good at understanding what users want and how they act.
